## Description
In Lua, `table` is the primary data structure for storing data. It can be used as arrays, objects, and even classes.

- Tables are indexed starting from 1.
- You can create multidimensional (2D) arrays.
- They are highly flexible and can contain mixed data types.

## Constructor
```
{}
```

Creates a new `table` object.

## Functions
`table` comes with a variety of functions to manipulate data:

### Static Utilities

[`next()`](next)  
  Allows a program to traverse all fields of a table.  

[`setmetatable()`](setmetatable)  
  Sets the metatable for the table.  

[`getmetatable()`](getmetatable)  
  Returns the associated metatable.  

[`rawset()`](rawset)  
  Sets the value of table[index] directly, bypassing metatables.  

[`rawget()`](rawget)  
  Returns the value of table[index] directly.  

[`pairs()`](pairs)  
  Used to iterate over all key-value pairs in the table.  

[`ipairs()`](ipairs)  
  Iterates numerically over the table.  


### Instance Methods  
Some common instance methods provided by the table library include:  

[`table.insert()`](insert)  
Adds an element to the table.  

[`table.remove()`](remove)  
Removes an element from the table.  

[`table.pack()`](pack)  
Packs elements into a new table.  

[`table.unpack()`](unpack)  
Unpacks a table into values.  

[`table.concat()`](concat)  
Combines the elements of a table into a string.  

[`table.sort()`](sort)  
Sorts the elements in a table.  

[`table.move()`](move)  
Moves a range of elements from one part of a table to another.
